# Supervised-ML-Algorithms

We will be implementing some well known Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to solve the following questions. 

1. Using KNN algorithm classify the following test case on iris dataset
Sepal Length : 5.2
Sepal Width : 3.1
Species : ?

Consider K=3

2. Create a classifier based on Bayes theorem that predicts whether a passenger on the titanic ship survives or dies.

3. Create a decision tree classifier that can detect which drug out of five drugs (Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y) might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. 

4. A submarine has entered into enemy waters. Here underwater mines are placed. The submarine uses sonar signal to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean. Your job is to create an SVM classifier for this task.


#### Find the answers to the following questions in Assignment-2.ipynb

1. Using linear regression predict the monthly salary of a person when his/her years of experience is 9.9 years.

2. a. Find the types of wine in the following data using k-means clustering, consider k=3.
b. Find the types of wine in the following data using k-medoid clustering, consider k=2.

3. Show the dendrogram cluster for the following dataset using
a. Single Linkage
b. Complete Linkage
c. Average Linkage

4. Create a classifier using logistic regression and find out how accurately it can predict the possibility of a heart disease based on the given dataset.
Also show the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score along with the confusion matrix and ROC curve.
