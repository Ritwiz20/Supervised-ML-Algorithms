# Supervised-ML-Algorithms

We will be implementing some well known Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to solve the following questions. 

1. Using KNN algorithm classify the following test case on iris dataset
Sepal Length : 5.2
Sepal Width : 3.1
Species : ?

Consider K=3

2. Create a classifier based on Bayes theorem that predicts whether a passenger on the titanic ship survives or dies.

3. Create a decision tree classifier that can detect which drug out of five drugs (Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y) might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. 

4. A submarine has entered into enemy waters. Here underwater mines are placed. The submarine uses sonar signal to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean. Your job is to create an SVM classifier for this task.
